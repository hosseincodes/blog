            <p>Innovation Factories are the needs of all cities. and now in Mashhad, we have a place that all the startups can come together and work on the city's problems. Because this factory was built near the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.um.ac.ir/">Ferdowsi university</a>, it has created a special opportunity to guide students to the labor market.</p>
            <p>First of all, when I was getting closer to the factory, beautiful architecture got my attention. Inside was like the Facebook office :-)... and there is another interesting thing about Mashhad Innovation Factory; Before it was made. there was a Coca-Cola factory in place, and you can still see the remnants of the old factory there.</p>
            <p>I went there with my cousin Saber. The presentation was about See5 company, their services, and achievements. When it was time to ask questions, I asked about the technical side of their product. their product is a website builder like <a target="_blank" href="https://wix.com/">Wix</a> that users can make their website without any technical skills. My question was this "Why do you use WordPress system for your services? According to you want to enter the international market, isn't it better to create a dedicated system?" and they answered me "We already have a dedicated system, but we didn't use this for our customers because WordPress is Simpler to use and it has more customization capabilities."</p>
            <p>When the event ended, we went to the CEO and Saber talked about is he too old to learn programming languages? and CEO said absolutely not! as well as the CEO offered him to take an internship in their company. I answered another question about my way to university and as I want to study Artificial Intelligence what path should I take? he said keep going on your school lessons and try to make money besides that according to your programming skills.</p>
            <p>In the end, I think that was a helper event for me. and I'm happy to participate in that.</p>
