        <h1 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Why I started this blog?</h1>
        <p>last day I watched a YouTube video about 21 Life Lessons for Teenagers. one of the suggestions was to create a blog and write your thought on that. I decided to create this blog in the last days of 2021 and the begging of my exams! I think this is a good idea to chill and make my thoughts clear. I also want to archive these posts for the future in GitHub (maybe this will be my diary on the internet! I’m so excited about that)</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 15px;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W3CDMcWlPyM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
        <p>In this blog, I will write about the news that I  interested in, my school study and exams, the travels that I will go, My country city and people around me, The movies and series that I watched, My programming work, and how I make money and Etc.</p>
        <p>maybe you will see a lot of English problems in this blog, please take comfort in me. I’m just the begging and I will try to improve my English knowledge in this way.</p>
        <p>Join me on this journey… :)</p>
