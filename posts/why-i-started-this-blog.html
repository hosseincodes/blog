        <h1 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Why I started this blog?</h1>
        <p>Last day I watched a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3CDMcWlPyM&list=LL&index=3">YouTube video</a> about 21 Life Lessons for Teenagers. One of the suggestions was to create a blog and write your thought on that. I decided to create this blog in the last days of 2021 and on the beginning of my exams! I think this is a good idea to chill and make my thoughts clear. I also want to archive these posts for the future in my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hosseincodes/blog">GitHub</a> (maybe this will be my diary on the internet! I’m so excited about that).</p>
        <p>In this blog, I will write about the news that I  interested in, my school study and exams, the travels that I will go, My country city and people around me, The movies and series that I watched, My programming work, and how I make money and Etc.</p>
        <p>maybe you will see a lot of English problems in this blog, please take comfort in me. I’m just on the beginning and I will try to improve my English knowledge in this way.</p>
        <p>Join me on this journey… :)</p>
